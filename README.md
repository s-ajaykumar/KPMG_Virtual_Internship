<p align=center>Ask</p>

- Used SMART strategy.

	- S - Specific
	- M - Measurable
	- A - Action oriented
	- R - Relevant
	- T - Time bound

### Qns:

- To determine who provides the most value, we need to know each new customer’s value.
 But we don't have any prior transactions with the new customers.
- So, how can we determine which customers to target?
### Soln:
- The common data between the old customers database and the new customers database are age, past_3_years_bike_related_purchases, job_title, job_industry_category, wealth_segment,  owns_car, tenure, postcode, country, state.
- So if we find which segment customers in the old customers list provides more value then based on that we can achieve our goal.
